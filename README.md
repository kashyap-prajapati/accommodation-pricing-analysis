# accommodation-pricing-analysis
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into the pricing strategies of various hotels. The analysis is based on current data.

# 
The idea of the project is to analyze and understand hotel prices to get a better deal when booking tickets near the travel date specified.

Choose at least three websites to crawl (e.g. booking.com, trivago.ca, hotels.com, etc.).  
Specify the details of your search (city, dates, number of rooms, etc.).  
Implement required features (see Final Project Information.pdf, Instructions). 
Compare deals and show the best deal to the user.

# features

- Web crawler; - Kashyap
- Data validation using regular expressions - Sachreet
- HTML parser; - Kashyap
- Inverted indexing - Samiksha
Inverted indexing lets us perform quick searches without going through all the files. This can be
represented as an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its
locations in a set of documents.
- Frequency count; - Aditya
Frequency count shows the user the number of occurrences of a word in a specific URL.
- Page ranking; - Samiksha
Page ranking is used to measure the importance of a search result based on the number of occurrences.
Search keywords that are repeated more within a web page will be ranked higher than the others.
Ranking web pages can be performed using sorting, heaps, or other data structures.
- Spell checking - Subhram
Spell checking can be achieved by constructing a vocabulary based on all existing words in text files.
If you don't find any additional word suggestions, you should be provided.
The edit distance algorithm can be used to compare the user's input with existing words from source files.
- Word completion - Sachreet
- Search frequency - Aditya 
Ability to show the word that has been searched before as well as the number of times the word has been
searched.
- Finding patterns using regular expressions - Subhram
